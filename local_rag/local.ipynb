      "Answer: Based on the context provided, the purpose of the course appears to be to teach students how to build machine learning systems that work in the real world. The course aims to provide practical experience and hands-on training, rather than just teaching basic ideas or theories. The instructor wants to help students unlearn what they think machine learning is and instead focus on building end-to-end systems from scratch. The course offers lifetime access to live sessions, coding instructions, and final projects, with the goal of providing direct feedback on students' work.\n",

Many students take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates. The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program when life gets in the way.\" This suggests that upon completion of the course, students will receive a program certificate as a memento of their accomplishment.\n",

       "[' Based on the provided document, the purpose of the course \"Building Machine Learning Systems That Don\\'t Suck\" is to provide students with practical skills and insights into building machine learning systems that work in real-world scenarios. The course focuses on designing and writing code to build an end-to-end machine learning system from scratch and covers best practices for tackling challenges faced by machine learning engineers. The course also teaches how to use various techniques like active learning, distributed training, adversarial validation, human-in-the-loop deployments, model compression, test-time augmentation, testing in production, among others. Additionally, the course covers creating training, deploying, monitoring, and inference pipelines using Amazon SageMaker and open-source tools. The course emphasizes learning from real-life examples instead of theoretical concepts.',\n",
